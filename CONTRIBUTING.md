# Contributing

Please see the [TODO.md](TODO.md) document for a general outline of what is currently being worked on and needs to be done.

Either:

- Start contributing wherever you see fit, using feature branches and make PRs
- Inquire as to where you can best contribute

## Current status

Currently we are in great need of a full test suite and to cleanup/refactor what has already been coded, mostly in the `src/ts/node/tester` folder.

When the code is clean and test suite looking good, with decent (~85% code coverage) we can extract libs (as mentioned in `TODO` doc).
