# Declarations

* Variables
* Variable
* Class
* Function

In reality there is no such thing as a "variable". Only named references to Objects.

* a Function is an object
* a Class is a constructor function (an object)
* primitives are Objects etc.

What we have are:

* declaration without assignment
* declaration with assignment (expression)
* class
* function

Note that you can declare a function or class either via assignment or shorthand (same thing)
